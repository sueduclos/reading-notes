### Discussion Questions:

#### 1. What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?
Once you define an object in some languages you can no longer change the variable to be of a different type. JavaScript, on the other hand, does not care about the type of an object, and you can change it on the fly as needed.
#### 2. What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type? 
Because JavaScript doesnâ€™t enforce type, you can get into strange situations where your variable is not containing the type of data that it should. These kinds of errors can become very hard to track and solve in large code bases.
#### 3. Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?
No, the parameters should not be changed. If the function changes the value of an argument, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function. 
#### 4. Describe a type of data that has rules, aside from the given examples of Number, Integer and Float. What are the rules the data should follow?
A Boolean is a data type that can only return true or false.
