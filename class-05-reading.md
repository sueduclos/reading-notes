### Discussion Questions:

#### 1. What is a data structure?
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. Data structures are the way we are able to store and retrieve data.

#### 2. How is a Linked List different from an array?
An array is the data structure that contains a collection of similar type data elements whereas the Linked list is considered as non-primitive data structure contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.

#### 3. What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array? 
Ease of insertion/deletion.
 
#### 4. What data does a `Node` hold in a doubly Linked List?
Each Node holds a link to the next AND previous

#### 5. What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variableâ€¦?)
Linked lists are implemented by using classes.
