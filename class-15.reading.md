## Class 15: DSA: Trees

### Common terminology for a binary tree:

-   `root` - The first or starting `Node` of the tree. Everything branches from this `Node`
-   `left` - The **left child** is the `Node` to the left of a parent `Node`
-   `right` - The **right child** is the `Node` to the right of a parent `Node`
-   **edge** - An edge is a connection between two `Nodes`. In code, this is not really phyically represented, it's just a representation of the references between a parent `Node` and the child `Node`.
-   **leaf** - A leaf `Node` is a `Node` without any subsequent edges / connections
-   **height** - The height of a tree is the number of `Node` "levels" it has, usually counted via the number of edges from top to bottom.

### Discussion Questions:

#### 1.What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes? 

#### 2. Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre,  in, and post order? 

#### 3. What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for? 

#### 4. How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?
