### Discussion 

Redux has a lot of “boilerplate” code that you have write, and every developer or company will have their own internal pattern for putting it all together.The makers of Redux have recognized that Redux is complicated and have introduced a “Batteries Included, Highly Opinionated” framework for making stores called the Redux Toolkit

This toolkit specifies a few different means of building a reducer and action set that work well together and are easier to understand and integrate.
