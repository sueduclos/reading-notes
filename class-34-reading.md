### Discussion 

1. What is native development?

Native mobile app development involves building apps for particular mobile operating systems, and users access them from dedicated app stores (such as the App Store or Google Play).

2. Why is it important to develop a native app vs a responsive react app? 

All in all, the cons of native apps are time and money, while the pros are the quality of the product and the wide range of development possibilities. Internet connection is not always necessary. Better performance, increased functionality, and enhanced security for user.
  
* It’s still just state and components
   * But no HTML or CSS
   * You can still “style” things using the framework guidelines
    
#### Expo

* Expo Is the dev environment
* Snack is an online sandbox
* expo-cli is the local equivalent to create-react-app (you can eject)
* Running locally, you can use your own device or the official simulator
    * Only Apple users can test iPhones
    * Anyone can test android, but you need to start up an ADB from The Android Studio IDE
