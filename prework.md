### Notes
#### How to Solve Programming Problems

Simple Steps

You can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

* As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3

#### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive
> How you value your time is how you value your life

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

#### How to think like a programmer

Lessons in problem solving
> “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

1. **Understand:** How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English. This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).

2. **Plan:** Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution! Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps. Don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. **Divide:** Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry. Instead, break it into sub-problems. Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

4. **Stuck?:** The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated. Debug, Reassess, Research. Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

5. **Practice:** If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems! Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.” Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties,etc. 

#### Five Whys and Five Hows

> “that by repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear.” - Sakichi Toyoda

The five whys and five hows constitute a questioning process designed to drill down into the details of a problem or a solution and peel away the layers of symptoms.
The five whys are used for drilling down into a problem and the five hows are used to develop the details of a solution to a problem.
Both are designed to bring clarity and refinement to a problem statement or a potential solution and get to the root cause or root solution.

How to use it: 1. Draw a box at the top of a piece of flip chart paper and clearly write down the problem or solution to be explored. 2.Below the statement box draw five lines in descending order. 3. Ask the “Why” or “How” question five times and write the answers on the lines drawn from number one to five.

> “If you don’t ask the right questions, you don’t get the right answers. A question asked in the right way often points to its own answer. Asking questions is the ABC of diagnosis. Only the inquiring mind solves problems.” - Edward Hodne, a British poet
